# Turbo CDN Integration

This document describes the integration of turbo-cdn 0.3.0 into py2pyd for enhanced download performance.

## Overview

We have replaced the existing download logic with turbo-cdn 0.3.0, which provides:

- **Intelligent Geographic Detection**: Automatic IP geolocation with multiple API fallbacks
- **Extensive CDN Mirror Sources**: 16+ optimization rules across 6+ package managers
- **Real-time CDN Quality Assessment**: Performance monitoring and dynamic ranking
- **High-Performance Architecture**: Advanced optimization modules for better download speeds

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated

Added to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
turbo-cdn = "0.3.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

### 2. New Module: `src/turbo_downloader.rs`

Created a new module that provides:
- `TurboDownloader`: Main downloader struct using turbo-cdn
- `smart_download_file()`: Smart function that tries turbo-cdn first, falls back to reqwest
- `fallback_download_file()`: Original reqwest-based download for compatibility

### 3. Updated Download Logic

Modified `src/python_env/mod.rs`:
- Replaced `download_file()` function to use `smart_download_file()`
- Added import for the new turbo downloader module
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback mechanism

### 4. API Usage

The integration uses turbo-cdn's async API:
```rust
// URL optimization
let optimized_url = turbo_cdn::async_api::quick::optimize_url(url).await?;

// Quick download
let result = turbo_cdn::async_api::quick::download_url(url).await?;
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Downloads**: Automatic CDN optimization for GitHub releases and other sources
2. **Better Reliability**: Fallback mechanism ensures downloads work even if turbo-cdn fails
3. **Geographic Optimization**: Automatically selects the best CDN based on location
4. **Transparent Integration**: No changes to existing py2pyd CLI interface

## Testing

Run the example to test turbo-cdn integration:
```bash
cargo run --example turbo_cdn_test
```

## Fallback Behavior

The implementation includes a robust fallback mechanism:
1. First, try turbo-cdn for optimized download
2. If turbo-cdn fails, fall back to the original reqwest-based download
3. This ensures py2pyd continues to work even if turbo-cdn has issues

## Future Improvements

- Add progress reporting for turbo-cdn downloads
- Implement caching for optimized URLs
- Add configuration options for CDN preferences
- Integrate with py2pyd's logging system for better visibility

## Compatibility

This integration maintains full backward compatibility:
- All existing py2pyd commands work unchanged
- Fallback ensures downloads work in all environments
- No breaking changes to the public API
